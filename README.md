# Password Generator

## Description:

The purpose of this project was to create a static website that generates passwords based on user specified criteria.

### This was completed by...

- [x] User is prompted for preferred password length / between 8 and 128 characters
- [x] User is prompted for preferred character types / lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special
- [x] User cannot enter invalid criteria
- [x] Password is then displayed on the page

### Note - since this is only an exercise:

- There are more optimial solutions involving regex and string properties, but those are outside of the scope for this lesson.
